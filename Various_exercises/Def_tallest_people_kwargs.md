Given a person's name as a keyword argument and their height as its value, declare a function tallest_people(). It should print the names of the tallest people along with their heights.

If there are several names, sort them alphabetically. Also, pay attention to the output format: Name : height.

You are not supposed to handle input or call tallest_people(), just implement this function.
